CONVOLUTIONAL VIDEO CAPTIONING

Video Captioning using CNN decoder

Video captioning is a task of automatically generating the textual descriptions of video.It is an important yet challenging task where challenges are due to the high variability and ambiguity of possible Video descriptions. In recent
years significant progress has been made in video captioning, using Recurrent Neural Networks powered by long short-term-memory (LSTM) units. Despite mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, and despite their compelling ability to memorize dependencies, LSTM units are complex and inherently sequential across time. Inspired by the success of convolutional neural networks in neural machine translation , CNN is used as a caption decoder in this work. We also perform a detailed analysis, providing compelling reasons in favor of convolutional language generation approaches
